    content: `# Understanding Type 1: The Perfectionist

Type 1 personalities are driven by a desire to be good, right, and perfect. They are principled, purposeful, self-controlled, and perfectionistic individuals who strive to improve everything around them.

## Core Characteristics

Type 1s are motivated by their inner critic - an internal voice that constantly points out what's wrong and needs to be fixed. This drives them to:

- Maintain high standards for themselves and others
- Focus on details and accuracy
- Work systematically and methodically
- Feel responsible for making things better

## Strengths

- **Integrity**: They have strong moral principles and stick to them
- **Quality Focus**: They produce excellent work and pay attention to details
- **Improvement Oriented**: They naturally see how things can be better
- **Reliable**: Others can count on them to do the right thing

## Growth Areas

- **Perfectionism**: Can become paralyzed by the need to get everything perfect
- **Criticism**: May be overly critical of themselves and others
- **Rigidity**: Can struggle with flexibility and spontaneity
- **Resentment**: May build up anger when others don't meet their standards

## Path to Growth

For Type 1s to grow, they need to:

1. **Practice Self-Compassion**: Learn to be gentler with themselves
2. **Embrace "Good Enough"**: Recognize when something is adequate rather than perfect
3. **Express Emotions**: Allow themselves to feel and express anger appropriately
4. **Find Joy**: Make time for fun and spontaneous activities

## In Relationships

Type 1s bring dedication and reliability to relationships, but may struggle with:
- Being overly critical of partners
- Having difficulty relaxing and being spontaneous
- Expecting others to share their high standards

Understanding these patterns can help Type 1s build healthier, more fulfilling relationships.`,

    content: `# How to Grow as a Type 2: The Helper

Type 2 personalities can grow by learning to recognize their own needs and developing healthy boundaries while maintaining their natural gift for caring about others.

## Understanding Your Patterns

As a Type 2, you likely:
- Focus intensely on others' needs while ignoring your own
- Feel valued when you're helping or needed by others
- Struggle to ask for help directly
- May become resentful when your efforts aren't appreciated

## Growth Strategies

### 1. Practice Self-Awareness
- Notice when you're automatically focusing on others' needs
- Check in with yourself: "What do I need right now?"
- Keep a journal of your own feelings and needs

### 2. Set Healthy Boundaries
- Learn to say "no" without feeling guilty
- Recognize that helping others isn't always helpful
- Allow others to solve their own problems

### 3. Ask for Help Directly
- Practice stating your needs clearly
- Resist the urge to hint or manipulate to get needs met
- Accept that it's okay to have needs

### 4. Develop Self-Care Practices
- Schedule regular time for activities you enjoy
- Practice saying "I need..." without justification
- Celebrate your own accomplishments

## Common Challenges

- **People-Pleasing**: Saying yes when you want to say no
- **Martyrdom**: Sacrificing yourself and then feeling resentful
- **Indirect Communication**: Hinting instead of asking directly

## The Path Forward

Growth for Type 2s involves learning that you are valuable for who you are, not just for what you do for others. This journey requires patience and self-compassion as you develop new patterns of relating to yourself and others.`,

The Enneagram is not just a personality typing systemâ€”it's a powerful tool for personal transformation and spiritual growth. Understanding your type is just the beginning of a lifelong journey of self-discovery and development.

## The Growth Process

### 1. Self-Awareness
The first step in growth is becoming aware of your automatic patterns:
- **Observe Without Judgment**: Notice your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors
- **Identify Triggers**: What situations activate your type's patterns?
- **Recognize Your Inner Critic**: How does your type's "inner voice" sound?

### 2. Understanding Your Motivations
Each type is driven by core motivations that often operate unconsciously:
- **Core Desire**: What you're seeking at the deepest level
- **Core Fear**: What you're trying to avoid
- **Core Belief**: The fundamental assumption about life that drives your behavior

### 3. Recognizing Patterns
Every type has predictable patterns that emerge under different conditions:
- **Security Patterns**: How you behave when feeling safe and relaxed
- **Stress Patterns**: How you react under pressure or threat
- **Growth Patterns**: The direction of your development and integration
